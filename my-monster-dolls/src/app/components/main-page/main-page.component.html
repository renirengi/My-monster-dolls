      <p>Monster High is an American fashion doll franchise created by Mattel and launched on June 11, 2010.
        The characters are inspired by monster movies, sci-fi horror, thriller <br />
        fiction, and various other creatures. Monster High was created by Garrett Sander, with illustrations by Kellee
        Riley and illustrator Glen Hanson. The franchise includes <br />
        consumer products such as stationery dolls, bags, key chains, various toys, play sets and print/book series.

        Just months after launch, an animated web series was developed and released on YouTube. It resulted in the
        production and release of a number of direct-to-video television specials and films which were distributed on
        home video formats by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment and broadcast in the United States on cable TV
        channel Nickelodeon. The audiovisual media was touted as the modern-day motive to launch new doll characters in
        the digital era. In 2016, Mattel released a reboot and origin story called Welcome to Monster High, using
        revamped face molds, upgraded animation technologies and techniques, a slogan ("How Do You Boo?") and the song
        "This Is How We Boo", performed by Jordin Sparks.

        On February 23, 2021, Mattel announced the return of the Monster High brand, promising new content and products
        for the following year. Its television division announced a new animated series and a live-action film based on
        the franchise. Both projects will air on Nickelodeon in the United States in 2022.</p>
