I must confess that shoe design is the weak part of my game. I think it's because they're kind of like ice cream to me. I know the ingredients, I know how it's made, but sometimes I'd rather just enjoy instead of focusing on all the details.\n\nxx Clawdeen",

Her hair is pulled into a pony tail with a hair bump and is held by a red hairband adorned with a skullette surrounded by feathers.\nShe is wearing a purple & blue leaf print top with black faux fur shoulders and an asymmetrical hem. Beneath the top is a dress that features a pink bodice with diagonal stripes and a light blue mesh skirt. Under the skirt are black capri leggings with a serrated hem. Completing the outfit are mismatched blue wedges; the right is a gladiator sandal and the left is a winding snake-strap sandal.\nJane loves to accessorize. She has a light blue bone with feathers in one ear and a light blue claw in the other. Around her neck is a red three ring choker attached to a statement necklace with claws. On one arm is a dark blue bracelet and the other has a black fishnet sleeve, pink bangle, and light blue bangle. Around her waist is a dark blue belt decorated with three skullettes; the center one is larger with a red bow and hanging feathers. \nShe carries a dark blue purse and walking stick. The quilted handbag has a red handle, feather, and skullette clasp. Inside the bag are three pieces of paper. The walking stick features blue feathers around a skullette knob with pink bow. The stick is also a working pen. Also included with the doll is a black brush, doll stand, Jane’s diary, and Needles, her pet sloth.\nAge: 15 or 16\n\nMonster Parents: Doctor Boolittle\n\nKiller Style: I suppose one would call my style jungle chic. I simply adore faux fur, animal prints and feathers. I also have an absolutely smashing walking stick I cannot stand to be without.\n\nFreaky Flaw: Spending my formative fears on a jungle island with only the companionship of animals did little to prepare me for the company of other monsters in large groups. When I find myself in that situation my pulse races, I breathe very fast and I start looking for places to hide.\n\nPet: Needles is my pet voodoo sloth. I love him dearly but he is always getting stuck so I constantly must make a point of telling him to be scareful.\n\nFavorite Activity: I love a good trek. There's nothing quite as peaceful and invigorating as exploring the wilderness and meeting the creatures that live there.",

She is wearing a a form-fitting sleeveless red dress decorated with a print of black fish skeletons and teal claw marks. On her feet are translucent teal peep-toe shoes with skeletal cutouts, fish accents, and large teeth-filled mouths for heels.\nIncluded with the doll is a white anglerfish skeleton on a purple base and a translucent teal shark head water bottle. She does not have a stand or brush.\nField trips are a clawsome opportunity to learn something new through interactive exhibits, guided tours and historical artifacts. They're also a creepy cool way to get a perspective on the past, present or future, and did we also mention it gets you out of class for the day?\n\nToralei thinks the ascarium is purrfect fun even if they don't give samples.",

She accessorizes with blue lightning bolt earrings and yellow pumps with lightning bolt cutouts and heels. Around her waist is a silver belt with a double row of holed hex nuts and a dangling chain. Pink, blue, or purple skullette lightning charms can be added to the belt.\nThe Recharge Chamber is a blue coffin-shaped chamber resting on a black circular pedestal. The inside is tufted gray with lightning bolt accents. It has neck and leg clips to hold Frankie in place. The clear doors of the chamber are etched with lightning bolts and sparks. The doors are framed in pink and topped with a heart. Beneath the doors is gray with a black skullette button outlined in pink.\nThe top of the chamber has twisting translucent magenta tubing and the back is etched with a stitched skullette surrounded by lightning. On either side and supporting the chamber are yellow lightning rods topped with skullettes.\nWhen Frankie is inside the chamber and the skullette button on the front is pressed, her hair stands up on end. The chamber requires 3 AA batteries to light up and create hair-raising static electricity. A brush is also included with the playset.",

      "description": "Sirena is stunning with her blue & purple hair. It is curled and worn in a high ponytail with three long braids on one side. Her ghostly pallor is offset by fin-like ears, webbed fingers, cutout fins on her forearms, and a beautiful mermaid tail.\nShe is wearing a sleeveless light green top with a print of dark green tentacles and strings of pearls. Covering the top’s translucent straps is a short black fishnet sash that drapes over one shoulder. On each wrist are black fishnet cuffs with long dangling looped tassels.\nAccessories consist of a silver pearl earring, a double-hoop earring made from chains and pearls, a triple-chain necklace, and a black belt. Attached to the belt is silver chain netting with scale-like hoops. The netting wraps around her tail all the way down to her fins. \nIncluded with the doll is a yellow brush and Sirena’s diary. A doll stand is not included. She is able to stand unassisted.\nAge: 17\n\nKiller Style: I like to combine fashions from both sides of my heritage like intertwining strings of pearls with my chains. I mean, if you're going to rattle around, you might as well be fashionable while you're doing so.\n\nFreaky Flaw: I guess some monsters think I'm a bit of an air fin, but what I actually am is a daydreamer. I'm always floating away in my thoughts, on land or sea.\n\nFavorite Activity: I'm super curious, so I love to treasure hunt in the sea and go to antique stores on land. I love scaring up unique and special freaky findings.\n\nFavorite School Subject: Archaeology. It's like a new adventure every day because you never know what's going to wash up with the tide.",

Her red peep-toe shoes have laces up the fronts and studs along the tops and sides.\nThis version is similar to the Signature doll, but also has the Ghoul’s Alive! feature.

The turquoise stripes have a pattern of mummy wrappings. Around the waist is a gold belt with triangle spacers and a dangling chain.\nLastly, she has a cream top covered with colorful hieroglyphics. Around the waist is a golden sash which leads to a shimmery pink skirt with a bandage pattern. A black cropped jacket is worn over the top.

Okay, well, that is actually true, but sometimes I like to go to the maul myself and do my own shopping, especially for shoes and accessories. Regardless, even if I did have a servant whose foot was as perfectly formed as my own, I still wouldn't let her choose my shoes because just because it fits doesn't mean it's comfortable, and there are some things even a princess must do for herself.\n\nxx Cleo",

I mean seriously though, if a ghoul is going to fashionably bloom, her roots need to be solidly grounded in some freakishly fab footwear, especially if you don't want to spend your unlife as wallflower.\n\nxx Venus",

It is the most perfect way to accent my best features, and what ghoul doesn't like getting a mani-pedi?\n\nFreaky Flaw: My parents say that even when I whisper I'm still about as quiet as an avalanche, but I am simply larger than unlife and I cannot hide, not that I would want to, what I am feeling inside.\n\nPet: I love llamas, even though I do not have one as a pet. I mean, how could I not love them? They are fuzzy and quirky and are as much a part of Monster Picchu as I am.",

She is wearing khaki coveralls with orange lightning bolt stripes and a name tag with “Stein” on the chest. On the right shoulder is a Ghostbusters logo patch. The legs have real cargo pockets and a sheer yellow cloth is tied around her left leg.\nShe accessorizes with yellow lightning glasses, blue lightning hoop earrings, and a silver dog tag. Around her waist are two belts. The first is silver with a lightning bolt buckle and the second one is a blue utility belt with a Skullette carabiner. She wears black wrist cuffs and black molded fingerless gloves. On her feet are high black boots with orange lightning down the fronts, zippers on the sides, and jagged lightning platforms.\nGhostbusting accessories feature an iconic black proton pack with a translucent yellow cable that connects to the gun. The proton pack opens and can store the translucent green slimer figure. Frankie’s last item is a black clip-on walkie-talkie.\nWho Ya Gonna Call?\nFrankie Stein!\n\nIt's not every day that there are ghosts at Monster High! Oh, wait, yes it is. But, paranormally, there aren't trespassing ghosts who zip around the howlways and classrooms leaving a trail of... ewww... slime!\n\nClawdeen found the little green slimer in her locker next to her ruined shoes. Then Ghoulia spied him wreaking havoc on the computer lab. Drac tried to catch him, but have you ever tried to fly when you've got slime on your wings? And Cleo - let's just say she took one look at the mess and felt royally ill.\n\nSo supernaturally, they called Frankie! She's a ghoul who doesn't mind lending a hand - sometimes literally - and a little ectoplasm dripping off her stitches isn't going to spoil her school spirit.\n\nFrankie got to work! She strapped on a proton pack and fired neutralizing particles like a pro... until it was hard to tell who caused more mayhem - Frankie or Slimer.\n\nFrankie chased down the howl, past the clawditorium and into the creepateria...\n\nEvery monster who had lunch that period was treated to a spooktacular show! Slimer bounced from tray to tray, gobbling down tater tots, chomping pizza slices, tossing Shriek salads, and wow, can he guzzle milk! All the while, Frankie was hot on his oozy tail, doing flips, somersaults, even the occasional pirouette!\n\nBut then Frankie had a voltageous idea! \"Hey Slimer,\" she called out to the happily munching ghost, \"why don't you join us? Grab a bite and fang out!\" Slimer stopped. No one had ever asked him to eat with them before! So Slimer joined the ghouls and had a grave time! And he ate every last bite... off everyone else's trays. But the ghouls didn't mind - he's really kind of cute once you get to know him... after he stops sliming you.\n\n",

Under the skirt is a sheer white petticoat with an embroidered lace hem made up of sugar skulls and heart designs. \nOn her feet are decorative pink wedges. They are covered with woven straps and have yellow emblems with “MH” and festive skulls. Skelita comes with her diary and an ornate black stand adorned with Skullettes, flowers, and a sugar skull on the base.\nI scream to dance among the humans...\n\nEvery autumn, when there is a bite in the air, the undead are invited by their living familia to cross over to the human world for a monstrous reunion. This spooktacular celebration is Dia de los Muertos - the Day of the Dead - and it is my favorite howliday - filled with bootiful costumes, to-die-for feasts, and, of course, dancing!\n\nEver since I was a bebé, I have attended the reunion with Abuelita - my grandmother - but this year she is unable to make the journey. I am un poco worried that without her, I will not receive my own welcome. But being a hopeful monster, I will dress up, put marigolds in my hair, and wait for my candlelit invitation to appear and guide me to the human world...",

It is oversized and designed to store all the pieces of the scooter when it is used as a surf board.\nHow Do I Boo? I float! I'm very chill in and out of the water. I try not to sweat things, but when I do I just swim it off.\n\nPersonal Style: I keep it casual, from sporty cute to surfer chic, so I'm always up for whatever's going on that sounds fun.\n\nMonster Quirk: When I'm out of water too long, I develop frightfully dry skin. I slather on so much skin cream, sometimes I'm as slippery as an eel-monster.\n\nLagoona is always a ghoul on the go... whether shes hanging 10 on her trusty surfboard, or zipping around on her speedy scooter. So leave it to Lagoona to sport a 2-in-1 combo: Her surfboard transforms into a scooter, and the extra parts are stored in her shell-shaped backpack.",

She has yellow-brown eyes, pink eyebrows, green swirled eyeshadow, and pink lips.\nHer brown skin is adorned with wood grain striations and branches protrude from her forearms. On her back are wing-like green ivy branches, a small bird house, and a knob. When the knob is turned, her ivy wings extend and she becomes taller as her torso grows.\nShe is wearing a peplum top with a black sweetheart neckline and a turquoise halter strap. The shimmery peplum and matching skirt feature a colorful wood grain print decorated with a variety of black insects.\nAccessories consist of black bug earrings, a brown vine headband, and turquoise wedge sandals with vines twisting up her legs. Six charms can be used to accent her branches and vines. The charms consist of flowers, bugs, and a spiderweb.\nTreesa stands in a brown tree trunk with cutouts, spiderwebs, and insects. It is accompanied by green ivy and turquoise webs. The trunk opens to reveal green hand-like clips and a base.\nMy mother taught me that being a tree nymph meant caring for all living things and cherishing our garden home, but she didn't warn me about my chaotic teen-in-tree-years! Not only are my powers coming in but my growth spurt has made me monstrously tall and I'm really branching out!\n\nAnd now I've accidentally showered some ghouls with my mystical pollen - causing them to sprout wings! I'm stumped as to how to fix this, but I love to sink my roots into a challenge.",

It is an exclusive of the Mattel Shop.\nCleo de Nile\nCleo has long black hair with blunt bangs, glitter highlights, and teal streaks. She has a tan complexion, light blue eyes, elaborate eye makeup, deep red lips, and a turquoise gem on her cheek.\nHer outfit is a black jumpsuit with elbow length sleeves and knee length legs. It is detailed with a print of winding golden lines and turquoise graphics.\nShe accessorizes with coral snakes on a gold statement necklace, gold armbands, and a gold cage peplum. On her head is an ornate gold headband decorated with a teal cobra. Her sandals have sparkly teal soles and golden straps with coral accents that wind up her legs.\nAccompanying Cleo is Hissette. The cobra is gold with a turquoise crown and jewelry.\nGhoulia Yelps\nGhoulia has long wavy hair that is streaked light and dark blue. She has a pale gray complexion, pale blue eyes, and red lips.\nHer outfit has a gray shirt with a breast pocket, black cuffs and trim, red buttons, and a drippy hem. The knee-length shorts are a pinstripe blue decorated with a turquoise skull print.\nAccessories consist of a bright green explorer hat, red zombie arm earrings, blue cat eye glasses, a turquoise scarf, and a red brain belt. On her feet are black knee-high boots with red laces and bright green heels. She carries a black torch with orange flame and a gray satchel with a red zombie hand graphic. \nWith Ghoulia is Sir Hoots A Lot. The owl is bright green with yellow eyes and blue accents.\nIf you have ever been trapped in a pyramid for thousands of years, you know how dreadfully boring it can be. If you were also trapped in that pyramid with only your pet cobra to keep you company and aid in your pranks against your rather abhorrent sister, you can imagine how \"poor\" (but actually quite wealthy) Cleo felt - entombed in an opulent palace with all of the luxuries her royal family had to offer, but no one there to admire and worship her. If you know all of that, you understand why she began to scream of a mysterious and bespectacled ghoul who would one day rescue her, befriend her, and, of course, idolize her. It was surely her destiny.\n\nIt is a little know fact that zombies are among the brainiest monsters in the world. They are often buried in deep thoughts and are able to solve mysteries and piece together puzzles much faster than their slow gait or moaning dialect would imply. As Ghoulia often says\"urghhhghgh ghrrrhhhh uhhhh,\" which roughly translates to \"I'm busy and enunciation is overrated.\" And, in fact, Ghoulia has been monstrously busy lately because she found what only a zombie with her superior intellect would consider \"a clue.\" Donning her hat and calling Sir Hoots-A-Lot, she sets off on an archeological expedition to dig up a grave treasure - the princess destined to be her true ghoulfriend.",
